# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to help Pewlett-Hackard prepare for the "Silver Tsunami" of upcoming retirees. We looked through multiple employee databases they have, and combined data from each to find who is likely to soon retire. We further filtered this by department to see what departments might need more recruitment. We also looked into who may be eligible for a "mentorship" program, involving employees ready to step away from working full time, and work as part time mentors.


Results: 

-We found that there are 72,458 employees born between 1952-1955. We decided that this group of employees will likely retire soon. That's a lot of roles to fill!

-We found that most (well over 50%) of potential retirees are in positions of either "Senior Engineer" or "Senior Staff". So these roles will need extra attention to be filled.

-We found that there are only 2 managers who are approaching retirement.

-We found that there are 1,549 employees born in the year of 1965 who would likely be interested in the mentorship program.


Summary:

Pewlett-Hackard will soon have over 70,000 roles to fill in the coming years. If P.H. decides to go with their mentorship program, there will be 1,549 mentors guiding what will soon be 70,000 employees. The calculation comes out to about 47 employees per mentor. That seems like a lot of employees to mentor while working "Part-Time". P.H may want to consider including more employees to be eligible for the mentorship program.
